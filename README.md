**Local Loyalty Card Storage**

A ultra-minimalist, privacy-first Progressive Web App (PWA) to replace bloated loyalty apps. No tracking, no accounts, no cloud—just your barcodes stored locally on your device.

## ✨ Features
- **Zero Bloat:** No external frameworks, no 2GB OpenJDK processes.
- **Privacy First:** Data stays in your browser's `localStorage`. Nothing is ever uploaded.
- **Offline Ready:** Works in the middle of a supermarket with zero signal.
- **PWA Powered:** Installable on Android and iOS home screens.

## 🚀 Getting Started

2. Add your store cards (Name, Barcode, and Customer Number).
3. Tap **"Install App"** or **"Add to Home Screen"** in your browser menu.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5/CSS3:** Vanilla frontend for maximum speed.
